## Objects and Classes:
  * Objects:
     * A real world element in object oriented environment, that may have physical or conceptual existence.
   * Classes:
      * Blueprint or description of objects, that can be created from it.
  
  
## Software development process:
  * Problem solving process:
     1. Requirements Analysis
     2. Design
     3. Implementation
     4. Delivery 


## UML Diagram:
  * The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard graphical language for modeling object-oriented software.
  * As UML is a graphical language, it supports two types of diagrams which can be classified as:

    * Structural:
      * The structural Diagrams are used to create a static model of the software. 
      * That is it gives an idea, what all components build up the system.
    * Behavioral: 
      * The Behavioral Diagrams are used to create a dynamic model of the software. 
      * It tells how the different components or modules interact with each other.


## Use Case Diagram:
  * In UML, use case diagrams are high level diagrams.
  * It provides a basic high level view about the system.
  * Four major components are:
    * System: 
      * The application/software component we are going to develop.  
    * Actor:
      * Any external agent that can interact with the system.
      * Two types:
        1. Primary Actors (on the left side of use case diagram)
           * Responsible for initiating action. 
        2. Secondary Actors (on the right side of use case diagram)
           * Responsible for Response/Reactions

    * Use-Case:
      * Shows task within the system. Example: Registration, Login, Search, etc.
    
    * Relationship:
      * Relationship are represented by solid line from actors to use-case.
      * Types:
        1. Association (between actors and use-case)
          * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55986045/128103237-29b4a4c5-925d-4655-a4a1-6fc46ed6fecf.png)

        2. Inclusive (base use-case -> inclusive use-case)
          * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55986045/128103613-88d874fa-47f1-4230-95f3-cfac2ce2bd37.png)
          <hr/>

        3. Dependent 
          * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55986045/128103677-2585bc6e-740e-429b-9523-ef6d2458f5d5.png)

        4. Inheritance
          * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55986045/128103766-d0785d00-aa0c-4175-80d2-5735f7ac1849.png)
